# David Starr Dunn personal page

This is my online portfolio site, were you can get to know me a little and see some of my work.

It's live on github-pages, and you can find it by typing davidstarrdunn.com in your browser.

This page was built with html, sass, and a little help from bootstrap and tweenMax from GSAP.
